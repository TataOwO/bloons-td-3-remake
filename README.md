# btd3 remake something

This is a project built using [PTSD](https://github.com/ntut-open-source-club/practical-tools-for-simple-design) framework  
please refer to that page to understand how you can install this because i think it's pointless to explain something that already existed and explained better than i can ||(or in other words, i'm lazy ☠️☠)||

but that's basically it
while in game, you can:  
press A to auto play
press P for some other keys

while in the map selector, you can type `NTUTOOPL` to access the secret map

while in the ice map, if you click the frog enough times, you will wake it up and he will be angy :(

while in the third map, if monkeys are placed in the correct order, there will be a monking
